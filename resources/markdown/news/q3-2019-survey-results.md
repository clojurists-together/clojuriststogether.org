title: Q3 2019 Survey Results and Call for Proposals
type: "post"

Thanks so much for your support and feedback in the latest survey. We value your opinions and always take suggestions into account as we make changes from quarter to quarter.

The call for proposals for new projects will close on Wednesday, July 17th, 2019 at 11:59pm PST.

We are checking our funding levels to work out how many projects we will be able to fund this quarter. We plan to fund each project at $3,000 USD/month for 3 months ($9,000 USD total). We'll update this post when we have final figures on how many projects we can fund before we select the projects.

### Have you seen any direct benefits from improvements to the projects we have funded?

A sampling of comments:

* "Not yet, but I've used both Aleph and Fireplace in the past, and I appreciate work going into them!"
* "Yes I use Neanderthal and it is improving."
* "No, because I don't use many of the funded projects, and those I do use (CIDER and clj-http) I was already pretty happy with. But, I give because if more people do that, the ecosystem can be a better place for everybody."
* "Fireplace in particular is a core tool as a Vim clojurian, so 👍"
* "Yes: we very recently adopted Kaocha at work and are liking that."

### How would you like us to allocate our funding?

Could do better:
