### Have you seen any direct benefits from improvements to the projects we have funded?

About half of the respondents to this question had seen direct benefits, and half hadn't.

### How would you like us to allocate our funding?

80% of respondents wanted us to fund a mix of established and speculative projects, and 20% wantes us to only fund established projects. This is roughly the same as our Q4 2018 survey. In Q3 2018 the mix was 70/30.

### What are we doing well, what could we be doing better?

Doing well:

- Communication & Community Updates
- Democracy in project selection
- Transparency

Could do better:

- Funding models and exploring different project time amounts
- Organisation promotion
- More collaboration with the greater Clojure community

We have plans to explore different project funding models in future rounds. Due to the Christmas holidays we didn't have time for it this round. If you have any specific suggestions of funding models or durations you'd like us to consider, please get in touch.

If you'd like to see more companies sponsor Clojurists Together, please reach out to them and encourage them to join.

Thanks!
