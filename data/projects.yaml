    A large part of that effort is happening in the [Scicloj community](https://scicloj.github.io/) with which this project is associated.

    The work that we’ll be doing with this funding will enable us to get closer to our goal of making Clojure a beginner-friendly solution for data science, thereby allowing us to expose the Clojure ecosystem to a different culture and to more diverse groups of users/programmers - starting with new developers and data scientists studying R as their main language.

Better tooling would encourage better testing practices, a better testing culture would encourage investing in tooling. Arne Brasseur is the main (and sole) developer of Kaocha.

  description: ClojureScript probably needs little introduction to most readers here. It is a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript to be able to target the browser, NodeJS, and the dozens of other platforms where JavaScript has a runtime. 83% of our members use ClojureScript in their work. We are funding Mike Fikes to continue his excellent work on the ClojureScript compiler. Mike is the number 2 or 3 [contributor](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/graphs/contributors) to ClojureScript (depending on how you count).
