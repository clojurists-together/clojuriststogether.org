## Call for Proposals. 
Happy July! It's that time again. 

Clojurists Together is pleased to announce that we are opening our Q3 2024 funding round for Clojure Open Source Projects.  Applications will be accepted through the 26th of July 2024 (midnight Pacific Time). We are looking forward to reviewing your proposals! [More information and the application can be found here.](https://clojuriststogether.org/open-source/)

We will be awarding up to $44,000 USD for a total of 6-8 projects. The $2k funding tier is for experimental projects or smaller proposals, whereas the $9k tier is for those that are more established. Projects generally run 3 months, however, the $9K projects can run between 3 and 12 months as needed. We expect projects to start on Sept. 1, 2024.

We surveyed our members again in June to find out what types of initiatives they would like us to focus on for this round of funding. Their responses are summarized below. In particular, it was great to see members' feedback relating to how often they used or referred to developers' work we have funded. Also noted that several of you plan to attend Heart of Clojure in Belgium in Sept. and Clojure/xxx in the US in October. Check this out!

If you are working on a Clojure open source project or have a new one in mind, especially one mentioned as a focus area for our members, consider applying. Or if you know someone that might be interested, please pass this information along. Let's get the word out!  If you have questions, please contact Kathy Davis at kdavis@clojuriststogether.org.

### What other information would you like to know about Clojurists Together and the work we fund?  

- Your updates have been great. The current amount of information is good.
- A roadmap of where clojurists together wants to go/grow to.
- It'd be great to learn about your decision making-process (which is so fruitful)!
- I'd also be curious to know about your approach to supporting new contributors and people from underrepresented groups.  <br>

### What areas of the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem need support?  
- Although this doesn't affect me personally, it is always good to make it easier for newcomers, so may some articles/documentation aimed at them, and maybe support for things like Kit Framework so they can get going quickly. (4 comments)
- A better test framework than clojure.test but ideally mostly compatible with current tooling. The implementation of clojure.test is borderline unreadable.  
- AI copilots specific to clojure libraries  
- Cloud deployment patterns & tooling  
- JVM/Clojure runtime has seen catch up with the JDK platform, but ClojureScript runtime seems to be a bit "stuck", which makes me worried.  
- Clojure Editor integrations  
- ClojureDart, auth libs for web apps
- Fairly bare-to-the-metal visualization. I'm still using Oz (vega, vega-lite), but it is not maintained. I am not that much interested in hanami, which is its own metalanguage on top of vega-lite, and I think cloj-viz wants to build on top of hanami again. At least oz I can debug by looking at vega/vega-lite code.
- 3rd Party Libraries, some of which have merges for fixes but no releases!  
- Structural editing  
- I'd love access to ClojureScript debugging within Emacs   
- Data-science   
- Making simple things easy, like Rails does.
- Calva support for simultaneous clojure+clojurescript from the same workspace
- Test tooling
- I was recently looking at test.check and clojure.spec.alpha and was having some trouble figuring out how (if at all) the two are related? Maybe some unification of these two concepts?
- The usual issues that crop up every year, like getting newcomers, error messages, and community engagement. Core team output feels stagnant; nothing in 1.12 feels worthy of a major release. Plus, it seems like Clojure is falling behind in just keeping up with changes to Java.
- Marketing. Rich's seminal talks were a fantastic advert for Clojure, but the tech market is fickle and nothing has really stepped in to replace these to attract companies in a position to create jobs.
- Library maintenance
- Documentation is still horrible for most libraries in the ecosystem- provided there is any at all. The core language is a central offender too. <br>

### What areas of the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem are strong? 
- Core language itself  
- Stability has been great (4).  
- Expertise is strong - but especially on Slack, where it is quickly swept under the tide of time. Slack has some very patient people with great advice. The design work that went into the language is showing it's benefit. 
- Good community, good tools and libraries developed by talented and experienced people, with a preference towards stability and backwards compatibility. Community is strong and welcoming. Documentation is there (though often in not always obvious places).
- Babashka and it's ecosystem    
- The libraries and general "can get things done with the language" abilities are super-strong.  
- Web development  
- Interactive developer tooling  <br>

### Are there any particular libraries, tools, or projects that are important to you that you would like to see supported?  
(Number of mentions in parentheses):
- Malli (8) and code quality tools generally, things that address the misconception that dynamic typing is malpractice relative to stat  
- Shadow-cljs (5) 
- Cider (5)  
- Babashka  (4) and more libraries useable in this domain (e.g. writing Excel files) 
- Jank (4)  
- Clojure-lsp (3)  
- com.github.seancorfield/honeysql(3)  
- com.github.seancorfield/next.jdbc(3)   
- metosin/reiti(3)  
- Clj-kondo (2)  
- uix v2 (2)  
- Calva (2) for an improved developer experience (not the same as more features).   
- Tech.ml.dataset (2) is looking really good - Chris's projects need to be included  
- Ring (4)  
- Re-frame(2)  
- Reagent(2)  
- Flowstorm (2)  
- Integrant (2)  
- Borkdude (2)  
- I still use lein for new projects because it is easy. It runs tests and the uberjar function is right there.  
- (1 each) Pathom and related, Asami, nt, uncomplicate libs, Data science stack, Core.typed, nbb, Clojure-ts-mode, Duct , Taoensso (tufte, timbre, sente), Weavejester (ragtime, crypto-password), Luminus/ring-undertow-adapter, com.fzakaria/slf4j-timbre, Conjure, ‘com.widdindustries/cljc.java-time, Datahike, Migratus, Hiccup, Oz, Scicloj  
- I would like a replacement for Oz to render vega/vega-lite, which isn't maintained anymore, and https://github.com/scicloj/viz.clj exists, which looks promising. Don't really care for the added layer of hanami in between-on top.  
- This Clojure Conj 2023 made me think that Clojure could rock really rock Data Science(2): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MguatDl5u2Q   
- I don't mind using Java interop now and again, but I would like to avoid having to write extensive Java in Clojure syntax.
Currently high on my list: anything bbatsov does (Cider, of course)  
- Nikita's Humble UI is a big deal for me - I hope it will get desktop app development going in a bigger way with Clojure  <br>
