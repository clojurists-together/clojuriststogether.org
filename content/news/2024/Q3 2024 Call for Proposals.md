## Call for Proposals. 
Happy July! It's that time again. 

Clojurists Together is pleased to announce that we are opening our Q3 2024 funding round for Clojure Open Source Projects.  Applications will be accepted through the 26th of July 2024 (midnight Pacific Time). We are looking forward to reviewing your proposals! [More information and the application can be found here.](https://clojuriststogether.org/open-source/)

We will be awarding up to $44,000 USD for a total of 6-8 projects. The $2k funding tier is for experimental projects or smaller proposals, whereas the $9k tier is for those that are more established. Projects generally run 3 months, however, the $9K projects can run between 3 and 12 months as needed. We expect projects to start on Sept. 1, 2024.

We surveyed our members again in June to find out what types of initiatives they would like us to focus on for this round of funding. Their responses are summarized below. In particular, it was great to see members' feedback relating to how often they used or referred to developers' work we have funded. Also noted that several of you plan to attend Heart of Clojure in Belgium in Sept. and Check this out!

If you are working on a Clojure open source project or have a new one in mind, especially one mentioned as a focus area for our members, consider applying. Or if you know someone that might be interested, please pass this information along. Let's get the word out!  If you have questions, please contact Kathy Davis at kdavis@clojuriststogether.org.

### What areas of the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem need support?

### What areas of the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem are strong?

### Are there any particular libraries, tools, or projects that are important to you that you would like to see supported?  
(Number of mentions in parentheses):
- Malli (8) and code quality tools generally, things that address the misconception that dynamic typing is malpractice relative to stat  
- Shadow-cljs (5) 
- Cider (5)  
- Babashka  (4) and more libraries useable in this domain (e.g. writing Excel files) 
- Jank (4)  
- Clojure-lsp (3)  
- com.github.seancorfield/honeysql(3)  
- com.github.seancorfield/next.jdbc(3)   
- metosin/reiti(3)  
- Clj-kondo (2)  
- uix v2 (2)  
- Calva (2) for an improved developer experience (not the same as more features).   
- Tech.ml.dataset (2) is looking really good - Chris's projects need to be included  
- Ring (4)  
- Re-frame(2)  
- Reagent(2)  
- Flowstorm (2)  
- Integrant (2)  
- Borkdude (2)  
- I still use lein for new projects because it is easy. It runs tests and the uberjar function is right there.  
- (1 each) Pathom and related, Asami, nt, uncomplicate libs, Data science stack, Core.typed, nbb, Clojure-ts-mode, Duct , Taoensso (tufte, timbre, sente), Weavejester (ragtime, crypto-password), Luminus/ring-undertow-adapter, com.fzakaria/slf4j-timbre, Conjure, ‘com.widdindustries/cljc.java-time, Datahike, Migratus, Hiccup, Oz, Scicloj  
- I would like a replacement for Oz to render vega/vega-lite, which isn't maintained anymore, and https://github.com/scicloj/viz.clj exists, which looks promising. Don't really care for the added layer of hanami in between-on top.  
- This Clojure Conj 2023 made me think that Clojure could rock really rock Data Science(2): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MguatDl5u2Q   
- I don't mind using Java interop now and again, but I would like to avoid having to write extensive Java in Clojure syntax.
Currently high on my list: anything bbatsov does (Cider, of course)  
- Nikita's Humble UI is a big deal for me - I hope it will get desktop app development going in a bigger way with Clojure  <br>
