## Clojurists Together Opens Applications for Annual Funding Awards for 2025  

This is the 4th year we are awarding annual funding. We’ve received an unmanageable number of nominations in the past few years, so based on member input, we’ve decided to try a new approach for 2025.  

**APPLY:** Anyone interested in receiving annual funding submits an [application](https://forms.gle/MaDL8ZiG7N7XyqVf8) outlining  what they intend to work on and how that work will benefit the Clojure community.  The deadline for applications is Nov. 12th, 2024 midnight Pacific Time.  
**BOARD REVIEW:** The Clojurists Together board will review the applications and select finalists to present to the members.  
**MEMBERS VOTE:** Ballot will go out to members not later than Nov. 20th.  Members will vote on the finalists using [Ranked Voting](https://www.rankedvote.co/guides/understanding-ranked-choice-voting/how-does-ranked-choice-voting-work). Deadline Dec. 2. Midnight Pacific Time.  
**AWARDS:** 6 developers will receive $1,500 USD per month in 2025. Awards will be announced no later than Dec. 9th, 2024.   
**REPORTS:** Developers submit bi- monthly reports to the membership.  


In the past 3 years, we have seen that giving developers flexible, long-term funding gives them the space to do high-impact work. This might be continuing maintenance on existing projects, new feature development, or perhaps a brand-new project. We’ve been excited with what they came up with in the last few years and are looking forward to seeing more great work in 2025! Thanks all and good luck!
