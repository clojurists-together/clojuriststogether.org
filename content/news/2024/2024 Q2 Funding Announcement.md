Clojurists Together is excited to announce that we will be funding 7 projects in Q2 2024 for a total of $35K USD (3 for $9K and 4 shorter or more experimental projects for $2K). To date in 2024, we are funding 25 projects or developers for a total of $223,000 USD. This includes the 8 long-term developers whose project work we are funding for the year. We expect to be able to fund another 14 projects this year for a grand total of $293,000. Based on our recent survey results we know that our members (and larger Clojure community) rely on this work on a regular (most on a daily) basis.  If we are able to engage more companies or individual developer members, we could fund even more important work - so please get the word out! 

As usual, we received a LOT of great proposals - so the decision-making was not easy. However, proposals are returned to the pool for another 2 rounds for consideration. We're looking forward to developer updates over the next 3-6 months!
