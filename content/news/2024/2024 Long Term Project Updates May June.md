## Bozhidar Batsov   
This period was quite busy and productive for CIDER and friends. The highlights are 3 (!!!) CIDER releases and a couple of nREPL releases:  

- [CIDER 1.14 ("Verona")](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.14.0)  
- [CIDER 1.15 ("Cogne")](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.15.0)  
- [CIDER 1.15.1 ](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.15.1) (small bug-fix release)  
- [nREPL 1.1.2](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/releases/tag/v1.1.2) (small bug-fix release)  
- [nREPL 1.2.0](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/releases/tag/v1.2.0)  

CIDER 1.14 is our most ambitious release since CIDER 1.8 ("Geneva"), that got released last autumn.  

The single most notable user-visible change of this release is that CIDER is now more robust when evaluating and displaying large values. CIDER will no longer hang whenÂ `C-x C-e`ing a big value in a source buffer or stepping over such a value with CIDER debugger.  

I'm guessing that many people will also appreciate the improvements we've made to flex completion (which is finally fully compliant with the Emacs completion API), the inspector and to the cider-cheatsheet functionality which was mostly redesigned.  

nREPL 1.2 restores the ability to interrupt evaluation on JDK 20+ (see https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/pull/318 for details) and CIDER 1.15 implements support for nREPL 1.2.  

More interesting work is in progress, so I hope I'll have another exciting report for all of you in a couple of months!  <br>
