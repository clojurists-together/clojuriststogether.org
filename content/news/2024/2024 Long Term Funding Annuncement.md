The votes are in!! Clojurists Together members have voted to to fund 8 developers $1.5k/month for 12 months ($144k USD total!). We're pleased to announce the following developers/teams who will be funded:

* [Bozhidar Batsov](#bozhidar-batsov)  
* [Kira McLean](#kira-mclean)  
* [Michiel Borkent](#michiel-borkent)  
* [Nikita Prokopov](#nikita-prokopov)  
* [Peter Taoussanis](#peter-taoussanis)  
* [Thomas Heller](#thomas-heller)
* [Toby Crawley](#toby-crawley)  
* [Tommi Reiman](#tommi-reiman)  

We are very excited to see what these developers will do over the next year. They will post updates every two months of what they've been working on, and we'll share them in our regular monthly updates. Here's what each of these developers plan to work on (although this is just a starting point and they're free to change their plans as they see fit):

### Bozhidar Batsov  
Provide continued support for CIDER, nREPL and the related libraries and improve them in
various directions. Some ideas that I have in my mind:  
- Make CIDER play better with alternative Clojure(Script) runtimes  
- Simplify some of CIDER's internals (e.g. jack-in, session management)  
- Improve CIDER's documentation  
- Provided out-of-the-box support for TreeSitter (via clojure-ts-mode)  
- Continue to move logic outside of cider-nrepl  
- Improvement to the nREPL specification and documentation; potentially built some test suite for nREPL specification compatibility  
- Various improvements to the nREPL protocol  
- Kick-off work on CIDER 2  


### Kira McLean  
I'll use the time that this money frees up to work on projects that benefit the Clojure community, starting with educational materials for the scicloj community, and continuing on with various related projects as the year goes on.  


### Michiel Borkent  
I'll continue to maintain and develop clj-kondo, babashka, SCI, cherry, squint and several all other related projects.  


### Nikita Prokopov  
I propose to work on the following open-sourse projects:
- Continue developing Humble UI, a UI framework in Clojure for building desktop applications  
- Documenting, promoting and teaching Humble UI  
- Develop data synchronization layer for DataScript, an in-memory database and Datalog engine  
- Support and extend Clojure Sublimed, a Sublime Text plugin for Clojure development  


### Peter Taoussanis  
Planned work includes:  
- Ongoing work for existing open-source libraries: improvements, maintenance, support, etc.  
- Stable releases for new libraries: Tempel (data security framework), and a structured telemetry library (final name TBD).  
- Continued work on updating Carmine core for latest Redis versions/features.  
- Detailed roadmap and timelines TBD based on demand/feedback, and how things progress.    


### Thomas Heller  
I'll focus on maintenance and further development of shadow-cljs, and other shadow-themed projects.  


### Toby Crawley  
My focus will be the ongoing maintenance for Clojars - including:  
- OS and system package upgrades  
- Reviewing and merging PRs  
- Deploying changes  
- Monitoring bandwidth/resource usage to detect anomalies  
- General operational tweaks and improvements  
- Tuning search algorithms  
- Security improvements, fixes, and responding to security reports  

### Tommi Reiman  
 I will work with Clojure Open Source projects, malli being the propable main focus, but also with new libraries that I find useful and are missing from the Clojure community/ecosystem.   


## Thanks
Thank you to all of our members for selecting these developers. If it wasn't for your generous support, this wouldn't be possible. I wanted to add a special thanks to Latacora, Roam Research, Whimsical, Stylitics, Pitch, Nubank, Cisco, Logseq, JUXT, Metosin, Solita, Adgoji, Grammarly, Nextjournal, ClojureStream, Shortcut, Flexiana, Toyokumo, Griffin, doctronic, 180Â° Seguros, and Kroo Bank. They have all contributed significant amounts to Clojurists Together which lets us award $144,000 in long-term funding to Clojure developers.
