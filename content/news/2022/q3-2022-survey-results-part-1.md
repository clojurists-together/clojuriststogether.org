> I would love to see a 100% ClojureScript SPA framework/library, i.e. without using React, or any other JS dependency. Thomas Heller is/was working on something along these lines at https://github.com/thheller/shadow-experiments, so I'd like him to get some support to push things forward.

> If any project comes up for CLJS code coverage, that would be awesome.

> I would like some kind of merge between vim-fireplace and clover for vscode! clover is nice (but misses this nice feature from vim-fireplace where you can replace an expression by its outcome). I'm not really interested in the full framework that Calva is. 

> I would love to see the core documentation getting some love: https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core, for example, https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/interleave to understand interleave I need to understand both "apply", "assoc" to grasp the first example. For someone dipping their toes in Clojure for the first time this isn't as trivial as seasoned Clojure developers might think. Some of the examples (although correct) are really hard to understand and could potentially add to the confusion for someone new.

**If you are a maintainer of any of these projects or would like to contribute to these projects, please consider applying.**
