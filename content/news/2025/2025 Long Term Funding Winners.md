The votes are in!! Clojurists Together members have voted to to fund 5 developers $1.5k/month for 12 months ($90k USD total!). We're pleased to announce the following developers/teams who will be funded:

[Michiel Borkent](#michiel-borkent)  
[Eric Dallo](#eric-dallo)  
[Dragan Djuric](#dragan-djuric)  
[Peter Taoussanis](#peter-taoussanis)  
[Oleksandr Yakushev](#oleksandr-yakushev)  

We are very excited to see what these developers will do over the next year. They will share updates of what they've been working on, and we'll post and email them as part of  our regular updates. You'll find summaries below of what each of these developers plan to work on (although they are just a starting points and they're free to change their plans as they see fit). If you want more detail, you can refer back to the proposals submitted on our [website](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/vote-on-2025-long-term-funding-applications/). 

Thanks to the all of you - the Members -  who took the time to review the applications and make the difficult decision to select just 5 from many excellent proposals. Congratulations are in order to Michiel, Eric, Dragan, Peter, and Oleksandr! For everyone else who submitted their projects, there will be more grant opportunities in 2025 - so keep posted. 

### Michiel Borkent  
My main projects are clj-kondo, babashka / SCI, and squint/cherry. I will develop new features, specified below per project. As usual I'll also work on ongoing maintenance and offering support on Slack and Github.  

### Eric Dallo  
I want to dedicate more time on big features for anything related to the Clojure LSP ecosystem, this includes: clojure-lsp and all integrations with editors, intellij, calva, lsp-mode, and so on.
Also, I want to improve the IntelliJ experience to be as good as Cursive, improving clojure-repl-intellij and clojure-lsp-intellij projects so we can have good options for LSP in any editors.  

### Dragan Djuric
My goal with this funding in 2025 is to support Apple silicon (M cpu) in Neanderthal
(and other Uncomplicate libraries where that makes sense and where it's possible). This will hugely streamline user experience regarding high performance computing in Clojure for Apple macOS users, which is a considerable chunk of Clojure community.  

### Peter Taoussanis  
Multiple projects, incl. further work on Telemere, Tufte, Tempel, and more. I have been trying to focus recent work on practical areas where Clojure either doesn't already have great solution/s, or where Clojure might be able to offer something uniquely advantageous over other languages/platforms. There's still a lot of low-hanging fruit re: both observability and data security for example. Beyond that, just focusing on practical tools that work at scale while being approachable for beginners

### Oleksandr Yakushev  
I plan to continue working on Clojure Goes Fast tooling. During Q3 2024, I've covered a lot of ground with new features and redesign of clj-async-profiler and the first release of Flamebin. This also opened a lot of ideas and opportunities for further improvement of those tools. I have a large backlog of tasks for:
- Flamebin – implement authorization and social login, client-side encrypted private flamegraphs, collaborative commenting, configuration editing and saving;
- clj-async-profiler – unified configuration, configuration reuse between flamegraphs, automatic analysis and performance improvement suggestions;
- Clojure Goes Fast knowledge base – populate the list of bad performance practices that can be later be linked to by the clj-async-profiler analyzer;
- clj-java-decompiler – CIDER integration which I wished to do in Q3 but couldn't get to in this quarter.

## Thanks
Thanks again  to all of our members for selecting these developers. If it wasn't for your generous support, this wouldn't be possible. I wanted to add a special thanks to Latacora, Roam Research, Whimsical, Nubank, Cisco, JUXT, Metosin, Solita, Adgoji, Grammarly, Nextjournal, ClojureStream, Shortcut, Flexiana, Toyokumo, Griffin, doctronic, and 180° Seguros. They have all contributed significant amounts to Clojurists Together which lets us award $90,000 in long-term funding to Clojure developers.
