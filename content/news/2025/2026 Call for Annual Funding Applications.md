Greetings folks!

Thanks to members' generous support, this is the 5th year we we will be awarding annual funding - $1,500 US stipend per month to 5 or 6 developers. In the past 4 years, we have seen that giving developers flexible, long-term funding gives them the space to do high-impact work. This might be continuing maintenance on existing projects, new feature development, or perhaps a brand-new project. 

We’ve been excited with what they came up with in the last few years and are looking forward to seeing more great work in 2026! Thanks all and good luck! 

### PROCESS
**Apply:** Anyone interested in receiving annual funding submits the [application](https://forms.gle/tGGTSteAbwENCHgq6) outlining what they intend to work on and how that work will benefit the Clojure community.  **The deadline for applications is Nov. 25th, 2025 midnight Pacific Time. Please note that past grantees must re-apply each year.**  

**Board Review:** The Clojurists Together board will review the applications and select finalists to present to the members by **Dec. 3rd**. We expect to award funding of $1,500 US a month to 5 -6 developers in 2026.  

**Members Vote:** The final ballot will go out to members using a [Ranked Vote](https://www.rankedvote.co/guides/understanding-ranked-choice-voting/how-does-ranked-choice-voting-work) election to determine the final recipients. As always, your input and participation is important and helps make Clojurists Together effective by ensuring members’ voices inform the work undertaken. **Deadline Dec. 12, 2025 midnight Pacific time**.
