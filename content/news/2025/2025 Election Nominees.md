Clojurists Together is in the process of [electing new board members](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/2025-board-nominations-and-our-annual-meeting/) to fill the four volunteer positions that are expiring this year. These positions are for two-year terms (approximately Nov. 2025 - Oct. 2027).

The board is responsible for governing the organization,  selecting and administering the projects that are sponsored,  and interacting with sponsors. It also facilitates decision-making and implementation for the future plans of Clojurists Together.  

We received 10 applications from the Clojure Community. 4 are from current board members who would like to continue to serve. All of the candidates are talented Clojurists that we would love (and be honored) to have on our board.  
 
The board has nominated all 10 candidates for the current board election (in alphabetical order of last names):

* Felix Barbalet (renewing board member)
* Daniel Compton (renewing Treasurer/Secretary)
* Rafal Dittwald
* Arthur FÃ¼cher
* Heather Moore-Farley (renewing board member)
* Felippe da Motta Raposo
* Christoph Neumann
* Max Penet (renewing board member)
* Howard M. Lewis Ship
* Daniel Slutsky


### Next Steps

All current Clojurists Together Members should have received a link to their ballot to vote via email. If you haven't received a ballot by 4th October (and you've checked your spam folder to see if it's hiding there), please contact kdavis@clojuriststogether.org. 

**Voting will close on 16th October at midnight Pacific Time**. The top four candidates, as voted on by members will win. Please note that our bylaws stipulate that "there may not be more than two members under the control or close influence of the same entity. If this threshold is crossed then members must stand down until there are no more than two members from the same entity". This year, there are 3 candidates from the same organization. So depending on the election results, we may need to make an adjustment after the votes are in. 


We will announce the winners shortly afterward and you'll be able to meet them at the Annual members meeting at [10 am Pacific time, October 29, 2025]((https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=2025+Clojurists+Together+Annual+Meeting&iso=20251029T10&p1=224&ah=1)
