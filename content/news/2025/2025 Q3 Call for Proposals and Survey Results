Greetings folks!

Clojurists Together is pleased to announce that we are opening our Q3 2025 funding round for Clojure Open Source Projects.  Applications will be accepted through the 25th of July 2025 (midnight Pacific Time). We are looking forward to reviewing your proposals! [More information and the application can be found here.](https://clojuriststogether.org/open-source/)

We will be awarding up to $35,000 USD for up to 6-7 projects. The $2k funding tier is for experimental projects or smaller proposals, whereas the $9k tier is for those that are more established. Projects generally run 3 months, however, the $9K projects can run between 3 and 12 months as needed. We expect projects to start on August 15, 2025.

A BIG THANKS to all our members for your continued support. And we want to encourage you to reach out to your colleagues and companies to join Clojurists Together so that we can fund even more great projects throughout the year.

We surveyed our members again in June to find out what types of initiatives they would like us to focus on for this round of funding. Their responses are summarized below. In particular, it was great to see members' feedback relating to how often they used or referred to developers' work we have funded. Also noted that several of you plan to attend Clojure/Conj, or made your way to SciNoj Light and ReClojure.   <br>
