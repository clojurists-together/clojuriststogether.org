Greetings folks!  

Clojurists Together is pleased to announce that we are opening our Q2 2025 funding round for Clojure Open Source Projects.  Applications will be accepted through the 17th of March 2025 (midnight Pacific Time). We are looking forward to reviewing your proposals! [More information and the application can be found here.](https://clojuriststogether.org/open-source/)  

We will be awarding up to $24,000 USD for a total of 5 projects. The $2k funding tier is for experimental projects or smaller proposals, whereas the $9k tier is for those that are more established. Projects generally run 3 months, however, the $9K projects can run between 3 and 12 months as needed. We expect projects to start on April. 1, 2025.  

A BIG THANKS to all our members for your continued support. And we want to encourage you to reach out to your [olleagues and companies to join Clojurists Together so that we can fund even more great projects throughout the year.  

We surveyed our members again in February to find out what types of initiatives they would like us to focus on for this round of funding. Their responses are summarized below. In particular, it was great to see members' feedback relating to how often they used or referred to developers' work we have funded. Also noted that several of you plan to attend Clojure/Conj, Clojure Berlin MeetUps, SciNoj Light, ClojureX, and ReClojure. CLojurists Together will be one of the sponsors of [ReClojure in London this May](https://www.reclojure.org/).  

Here is more from our February Members' survey.

### What areas of the Clojure and ClojureScript ecosystem need support?  
•	"Beginners" onboarding. I think we need to make a concerted effort to attract new people (not only people without programming experience) and make the initial stages of "getting into Clojure(Script)" much more guided. Even if that initially means "opinionated". Once a person has a minimum level of confidence, she can always explore other "opinionated options". Otherwise, we risk fragmenting the efforts, and making the learners confused (which can led them to rejecting the language).  
•	We need to gain more hype and visibility in the wider software development community  
•	Outreach to new developers  
•	Learning experience for people who are not senior developers. Build tooling and getting started material for newcomers  
•	Data Science - can I make an R-quality chart without Python?   
•	Shadow - linting and bus-factor - Shadow is fiendishly complex judging by the rate of questions on Slack, and there is just one expert.  
•	ClojureDart  
•	New use cases, data analysis, clojure in academia, beginner resources, interop  
•	JS Ecosystem interop. How to use stuff like shadcn, tailwind etc. These things should not be so different from how people do it in JS.  
•	Scientific Clojure and Clojure for data processing  
•	DX tools.  
•	Build tooling the introduction of deps has made the ecosystem more difficult to get into  
•	The developer experience - it is already good, but it could be so much better. Better, more usable error messages, stack traces and better / easier to use profiling tools and tools for structuring builds  
•	The core is stagnant, especially the spec debacle.
