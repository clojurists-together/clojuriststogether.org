As 2025 comes to a close we want to reach out and thank you for supporting Clojure, open-source, and the Clojurists Together community.  

#### We’ve been able to accomplish a lot this year with your support.  

In 2025, we funded a total of $171,000 of projects. 10 developers completed 12 shorter-term projects ($66,000 USD). 6 developers received a monthly stipend for the year ($105,000 USD in long-term funding). Since 2018, Clojurists Together has awarded more than $1.2 million to 87 developers working on more than 154 projects.  

Your input on our quarterly surveys is critical to ensuring that we are funding work that is needed, valued, and adopted by the community at large. 22% of members participate every quarter.  

30% of members participated in the process for selecting the developers to receive 2026 annual funding. Thank you for reviewing the proposals and voting!  

We appreciate your subscription to our regular news and updates dispatches - as we believe it encourages wider use of the tools and resources of the developers we have funded - strengthening and advancing the open-source and Clojure community. For those of you who subscribe but are not yet members, [you can always join the voting community for as little as $5 per month.](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/developers/). For those of you who are already members, even a small increase in membership contributions could enable us to fund more projects. Every little bit helps. 

We were able to attend the Heart of Clojure/Conj conference in the U.S. in November - and it was great to see and share with so many of you in person!

 
#### The developer’s work we fund is highly valued - and used daily.  

In addition to requesting specific tools and improvements, we have heard a consistent call for better documentation (content, presentation, and organization) and more support for engaging and supporting new Clojure users. This year, we received and funded several proposals that focused on these needs and will continue to encourage work in these areas. It is great to see that so many of you refer to and rely on the work the developers have undertaken throughout the year.
