**What do you plan to work on throughout the year?** 
My main projects are clj-kondo, babashka / SCI, and squint/cherry. I will develop new features, specified below per project. As usual I'll also work on ongoing maintenance and offering support on Slack and Github.

Links:
[clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo), [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka), [SCI](https://github.com/babashka/sci), [squint](https://github.com/squint-cljs/squint)  

#### [Clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo)  
- Linter for partially extended protocols
- Extend :discouraged-var to allow specifying arities
- Ongoing maintenance, there's always plenty to do! See the project board and see here for a list of most upvoted issues
- Experiment with adding the notion of a project classpath such that command line linting becomes easier. Possibly configurations could be read from the classpath as well.
- As clj-kondo is the foundation for the static analysis in clojure-lsp: improvements in the interaction between the two, most specifically the analysis data.

#### [Babashka / SCI](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)  
- Maintenance of included bb libraries: SCI, babashka.fs, babashka.process, deps.clj, babashka.http-client, edamame
- Babashka tasks: prefix parallel prcoess output such that you can distuingish tasks
- Better error locations for clojure.test output (https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues/1518)
- Report exception causes in console error report (https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues/1515)
- Several other issues: https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues

#### [Squint (and cherry)](https://github.com/squint-cljs/squint)  
- Browser REPL support
- Source map support (some work has been done, but far from finished)
- Increase overall compatibility with CLJS
- Support dependencies from the ClojureScript ecosystem from clojars and git depsAll other related projects
- Nbb, jet, scittle, neil, edamame, rewrite-edn, carve   

**Why is this work important to the Clojure community?**
Babashka is used by 90% of Clojure Survey respondents as shown in Alex Miller's Conj 2024 talk. Babashka and clj-kondo have 4.1k and 1.7k stars on Github respectively, their slack channel on Clojurians have almost 1800 + 1000 users. Clj-kondo and babashka are used by a large portion of the community. I think it's fair to say they are established project.  

**Do you receive any other funding to work on this project?** Yes, via Github Sponsors

**Is there anything else you would like us to know?** Thank you so much for Clojurists Together and keeping the Clojure OSS ecosystem sustainable!  <br>
