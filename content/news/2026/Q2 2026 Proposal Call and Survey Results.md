Greetings folks!  

Clojurists Together is pleased to announce that we are opening our Q2 2026 funding round for Clojure Open Source Projects.  Applications will be accepted through the 17th of March 2026 (midnight Pacific Time). We are looking forward to reviewing your proposals! [More information and the application can be found here.](https://clojuriststogether.org/open-source/)  

We will be awarding up to $33,000 USD for a total of 5-7 projects. The $2k funding tier is for experimental projects or smaller proposals, whereas the $9k tier is for those that are more established. Projects generally run 3 months, however, the $9K projects can run between 3 and 12 months as needed. We expect projects to start on April 1, 2026.  

A BIG THANKS to all our members for your continued support. We also want to encourage you to reach out to your [colleagues](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/developers/) and [companies](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/companies/) to join Clojurists Together so that we can fund EVEN MORE great projects throughout the year.  

We surveyed the community in February to find out what types of initiatives they would like us to focus on for this round of funding. **Given the themes that surfaced - many of which have been reoccurring, we are going to ask for proposals that address needs in the following areas:**     
**ClojureScript compilation**  
**Developer experience**   
**AI/LLMs**  
**Build Tooling**  
**Clojure Evangelism**  


This approach is a little different than in years past but we'd like to try it in hopes of making progress in areas that are important to developers and that will strengthen awareness and use of Clojure. Of course, you are welcome to submit proposals for projects outside these areas, but we will be evaluating our selection with a heavy weighting towards them.
