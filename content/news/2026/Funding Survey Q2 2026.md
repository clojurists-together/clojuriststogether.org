Greetings Clojurists! 

We are about to close our Q2 2026 Funding Survey which helps inform our Q2 project awards. It is not a heavy lift - maybe 5 minutes of your time.  But your input is invaluable! A link to the survey was sent to your email - and just in case it made its way to spam, you can look for "We Need Your Input - Q2 2026 Funding". The survey closes midnight PST on February 21, 2026.

Thanks as always for your support of Clojurists Together and for being a part of this awesome community.

Any questions, please email me at kdavis@clojuriststogether.org
