## Thanks
Thanks again  to all of our members for selecting these developers. If it wasn't for your generous support, this wouldn't be possible. I wanted to add a special thanks to Latacora, Roam Research, Whimsical, Nubank, Cisco, JUXT, Metosin, Solita, Adgoji, Grammarly, Nextjournal, ClojureStream, Shortcut, Flexiana, Toyokumo, Griffin, doctronic, and 180° Seguros. They have all contributed significant amounts to Clojurists Together which lets us award $90,000 in long-term funding to Clojure developers.
