## Dragan Djuric    
2025 Annual Funding Report 6. Published January 4, 2026.  

My goal with this funding in 2025 is to support Apple silicon (M cpus) in Neanderthal
(and other Uncomplicate libraries where that makes sense and where it's possible).  

Having achieved a lot of the goals for this project in 2025 in the previous 10 months,
in this funding period, my main effort was concentrated on the icing on the cake.  

- I improved support for various data types in Deep Diamond (including :double)  
- improved the implementation of the info method in DD  
- released Deep Diamond 0.41.0  
- improved cuda handling of :long descriptors  
- extended Neanderthal Vector with the support for Tensor protocols,
- extended Neanderthal Matrix with the support for Tensor protocols,  
- simplified the code in various places,  
- wrote new tests,  
- GE matrices are now also tensors  
- fixed the transfer support for integer matrices  
- implementated integer kernels for vectors and GE matrices in CUDA,  
- updated Apple BNNS tensor to be compatible with the changes in the last 3-4 months,  
- fixed leftover reflections in the old BNNS-based engine in DD  
- released Neanderthal 0.60.0,  
- released Deep Diamond 0.42.0,  
- Update upstream onnxruntime to 1.23.2, also build it locally with CUDA to update diamond-onnxrt,  
- released diamond-onnxrt 0.21.0  

I released several new versions of Uncomplicate libraries with these user-facing improvements including:  
- Deep Diamond  
- Neanderthal  
- Diamond ONNX Runtime  

Hammock time. Did some research on LLMs and the future Clojure implementation of high-level LLMs based on Diamond ONNX Runtime  

I also wrote a tutorial on dragan.rocks. I had plans to write more, but couldn't find time and energy, since December was especially full with lectures at the university, and I did not want to risk burnout :)  <br>

## Eric Dallo  
2025 Annual Funding Report 6. Published January 6, 2026.  

What a year! This was probably the year that I most commited and worked in some many things for Clojure community, all of that thanks to ClojuristsTogether, thank you very much!
In November I met so many people at ClojureConj that I work for 5 years and never met personally, it was a very good feeling to talk about so many subjects, projects, and hear about the best people in Clojure community. Check it out the picture with the biggest names in developer tooling for Clojure!

## Michiel Borkent  
2025 Annual Funding Report 6. Published x, 2025.  


## Oleksandr Yakushev  
2025 Annual Funding Report 6. Published January 8, 2026.  

Hello friends! Here's my update on November-December 2025 Clojurists Together work. I've dedicated time in equal parts to improving clj-async-profiler and to working on nREPL/CIDER stack.  

### clj-async-profiler  
I've released the first beta version of the quite disruptive 2.0.0 release of the profiler. The new version contains a whole new type of graph - a heatgraph - which incorporates time as a separate dimension, and allows constructing on-demand flamegraphs over arbitrary time slices. This new version also migrates from profiles as collapsed TXT files to the industry-standard JFR (Java Flight Recorder) profiles which incorporate more data and are more compact and efficient.  

- Released `2.0.0-beta` with support for JFR profiler data and heatgraphs.  
- [45](https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-async-profiler/issues/45): Released version 1.7.0 for the older pre-2.0.0 branch of the profiler to restore compatibility with Linux kernerl 6.17.  

### nREPL  
nREPL [1.6.0-alpha1](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/releases/tag/v1.6.0-alpha1) has been prepared which contains many updates that improve the stability of nREPL and simplify its codebase. nREPL is continually moving towards its original goal of being a simple reliable foundation for other tools to build upon.  

- [#403](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/pull/403): Fix off by 1 error in CallbackBufferedOutputStream.  
- [#408](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/pull/408): Refactor `stdin` middleware.  
- [#409](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/pull/409): Refactor handler construction and middleware application.  

### Orchard  
Plenty of work has gone into Orchard, mostly on the inspector and doc/Javadoc side. These changes will go into the next named CIDER release.  

- [#362](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard/pull/362): Info: don't crash if symbol contains $ or /.  
- [#363](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard/pull/363): Inspector: show duplicates in analytics.  
- [#365](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard/pull/365): Inspector: don't datafy vars.
- [#367](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard/pull/367): Inspector: pretty-print arrays distinctively from vectors.  
- [#369](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard/pull/369): Inspector: group methods by declaring class.  
- [#370](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard/pull/370): Inspector: dedicated view for methods.  
- [#371](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard/pull/371): Inspector: analytics improvements.  
- [#368](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard/pull/368): Print: correctly render empty records.  

### cider-nrepl  
Here I worked on the dependency footprint of the library. Cider-nrepl has many dependencies and a complicated solution to managing and shading them.  

* [#956](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/pull/956): [ci] Include nrepl dependency into releases again.  
* [#959](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/pull/959): Stop shading Compliment and clj-reload.  

### Virgil  
Released Virgil 0.5.1.  

- [#45](https://github.com/clj-commons/virgil/pull/45): Address reflection warnings.  
- [#46](https://github.com/clj-commons/virgil/pull/46): Enable linting on CI.  <br>

## Peter Taoussanis  
2025 Annual Funding Report 6. Published January 9, 2026.   

Hi everyone 👋  

Another year behind us! I hope everyone had a peaceful break, and managed to get some quality time with family/friends/pets ^^  

2025 was a productive year for my Clojure projects with >36 non-trivial [library releases](https://www.taoensso.com/news#2025) and one [talk](https://youtu.be/IlV8R6k8XvY) ("Effective Open Source Maintenance Maintenance").  

**Some highlights included:**  
- [Telemere v1](https://github.com/taoensso/telemere/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (now at [v1.2.1](https://github.com/taoensso/telemere/releases/tag/v1.2.1)) - Structured logs and telemetry for Clj+s  
- [Tempel v1](https://github.com/taoensso/tempel/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (now at [v1.1](https://github.com/taoensso/tempel/releases/tag/v1.1.0)) - Data security framework for Clj  
- [Trove v1](https://github.com/taoensso/trove/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (now at [v1.1](https://github.com/taoensso/trove/releases/tag/v1.1.0)) - Modern logging facade for Clj+s  
- [Tufte v3](https://github.com/taoensso/tufte/releases/tag/v3.0.0) - Simple performance monitoring library for Clj+s  
- [Sente v1.21](https://github.com/taoensso/sente/releases/tag/v1.21.0) - Realtime web comms library for Clj+s  
- [Truss v2](https://github.com/taoensso/truss/releases/tag/v2.0.0) (now at [v2.3](https://github.com/taoensso/truss/releases/tag/v2.3.0)) - Micro toolkit for Clj+s errors  
- [http-kit v2.9b1](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/releases/tag/v2.9.0-beta1) (now at [beta3](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/releases/tag/v2.9.0-beta3)) - Fast HTTP client+server for Clj  
- [Carmine v3.5](https://github.com/taoensso/carmine/releases/tag/v3.5.0) - Redis client + message queue for Clj  

My main unifying themes for the year were **observability** and **documentation**. I'm pretty happy now with the combo of Telemere, Trove, Tufte, and Truss. These work well together as a sort of opinionated **observability suite** for serious Clojure applications. And I think that together they offer a pretty compelling demonstration of some of the kinds of real-world advantages Clojure can offer people trying to get things done at scale.  

As always, a very big and warm *thank you* to the many users and contributors that helped patiently test, give feedback, report bugs, and offer improvements over the year. The Clojure community has always been and continues to be a special one ❤️  

Likewise a big thank you to the companies and folks (incl. [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/), [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/), and [other sponsors](https://www.taoensso.com/sponsors)) that have helped support my OSS work financially! It's been great being able to dedicate so much time to open source, and it's something I feel very grateful to have been able to benefit from 🙏  

Those closely following my releases may have noted that I was unusually quiet over Nov/Dec. tl;dr ended up with some unexpected Life stuff coming up that has required the bulk of my attention and energy. So a few releases I had planned for that period will need to wait until later (likely Q2 2026).  

Relatedly, I should warn that I might need to deload a little in 2026. Will still be providing maintenance and support as usual, just not sure yet to what extent I'll be able to contribute the usual amount of attention to substantial greenfield work.  

I'm in Clojure for the long haul, and will continue to be present and as active as I'm able- things may just be a little bit more unpredictable on my side for the next few months as I see how next developments play out.  

Best wishes to everyone for the new year, and much love to you all! 🫶
