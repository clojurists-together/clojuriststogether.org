Greetings Clojurists Together Members! Last year, we tried a new process to determine who will receive a monthly stipend of $1,500 to support their development work. It was a vast improvement, so this year we are using it again. 

We put out the call  - and we received 15 thoughtful applications for you to consider. The board reviewed and moved all 15 to the Ranked Vote ballot. Now it is up to you, the members, to select the 5 developers who will each receive $1,500 monthly stipends for a total of $18K USD. **Be on the lookout for an email that contains the link to your Ranked Vote ballot.** Deadline for voting is **12 December 2025** minight Pacific Time. 

 You can review past long-term project updates on our [website](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/) to get an idea of what past annual (or long-term) funding recipients have been able to accomplish with your support (pretty amazing!)

Thanks again to all the members for making this happen. We know from our surveys that you and the larger Clojurist Community that receives our regular updates refer to this work on a regular basis - xxx daily. This is a testament to its importance of these projects. 


Here we go ..in alphabetical order (by last name)....

### Deadline for your vote to be counted: December 4, 2024 Midnight Pacific Time
