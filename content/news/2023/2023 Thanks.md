## THANK YOU!  
As 2023 comes to a close we want to reach out and thank you for supporting Clojure, open-source, and the Clojurists Together community.  

We've been able to accomplish a lot this year with your support.  Your input on our quarterly surveys is critical to ensuring that we are funding work that is needed, valued, and adopted by the community at large. We appreciate your subscription to our regular news and updates dispatches - as we believe it encourages wider use of the tools and resources of the developers we have funded - strengthening and advancing the open-source and Clojure community.  It’s what we're all about. 

**We’re hearing from about 25% of our members and subscribers** on each of our quarterly surveys (which is actually pretty good as surveys go). In addition to requesting specific tools and improvements, we have heard a consistent call for better documentation (content, presentation, and organization) and more support for engaging and supporting new Clojure users. This year, we received and funded several proposals that focused on these needs and will continue to encourage work in these areas.  

**In 2023, we funded 30 shorter-term projects ($150,000 USD). 11 developers received a monthly stipend for the year ($187,500 USD in long-term funding). In total, we  funded $337,500 of projects in 2023. Since 2018, Clojurists Together has awarded $935,000 to 76 developers working on more than 120 projects.**  

We encourage everyone in the Clojurist community to stay involved - by providing input on surveys and submitting project ideas for funding.  In addition, members are able  to vote on the  annual Long Term Funding recipients as well as board members.  The more ideas, solutions, and engaged members, the better!!  And of course, as we increase membership funding, more resources will be available to fund important projects.  In 2023, 93% of our membership revenue was allocated to projects  – unheard of!!  (You can join as a [Developer](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/developers/) or as a [Company](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/companies/)).

### Hear from a few of our 2023 long-term developers:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*“Clojurists Together has helped me maintain and improve babashka, SCI,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clj-kondo while working on new projects like squint. I’m grateful that CT exists  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to help the Clojure open source ecosystem thrive.” - Michiel Borkent*    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*“I greatly appreciate the funding from Clojurists Together to support my work &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Clojars! Clojars is a critical piece of infrastructure for the Clojure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;community,and this funding allows me to focus on maintaining and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improving it.” - Toby Crawley*  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"The continuous support for my work on CIDER by Clojurists Together &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allowed me to keep it at the top of my OSS priorities and to provide a steady &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stream of updates throughout the entire 2023. It's safe to say that without &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clojurists Together CIDER wouldn't be what it is today. Thanks a lot for your &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support! You rock!" - Bozhidar Batsov*    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"Clojurists Together long-term funding has enabled me to take days off work &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and dedicate them to opensource projects, as well as providing a great &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incentive to turn weekends into opensource project time. This has enabled me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to spend a lot of time working on https://clojure-doc.org -- both reviewing and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; updating existing content as well as writing a lot of new content, to reflect the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes in the Clojure ecosystem over the last decade (much of the existing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content dated back to Clojure 1.4!) -- in addition to supporting regular updates &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and releases of projects that I've been maintaining somewhat irregularly over &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the years." - Sean Corfield*    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"Thanks to Clojurist Together Long Term Funding I’ve been able to find quality &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time on developing and maintaining open source libraries including malli, reitit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and others. I feel privileged for the support."- Tommi Reiman*
