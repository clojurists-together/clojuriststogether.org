## Call for Proposals. We're looking for ideas!
Clojurists Together is pleased to announce that we are opening our Q1 2024 funding round for Clojure Open Source Projects. Applications are open until the 24th of November 2023 (midnight Pacific Time). We are looking forward to reviewing your proposals!

We will be awarding a total of $44,000 USD for 8 projects – 4 projects at $2,000 each and 4 projects at $9,000 each. The $2k funding tier is for experimental projects or smaller proposals, whereas the $9k tier is for those that are more established. Projects generally run 3 months, however, the $9K projects can run between 3 and 12 months as needed. We expect projects to start for this round on January 1, 2024.  

We recently surveyed our members to find out what types of initiatives they would like us to focus on for this round of funding. Their responses are summarized below.  Thanks as always – it is extremely helpful in ensuring that the community is a vital source of input.  

If you work on a Clojure open source project, especially one mentioned as a focus area for our members, please consider applying.
