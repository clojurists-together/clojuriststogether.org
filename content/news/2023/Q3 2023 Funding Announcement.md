Hi folks. Weâ€™re excited to announce the projects we'll be funding for the Q3 2023 round. (8 projects $44K USD in total).
As usual, there were a lot of great projects - so making a decision was not easy. 

The good news, however, is that proposals are automatically reconsidered for the next 2 cycles. We have supported many 
projects in the past that were funded in the 2nd or even 3rd review - so it is important to check back when we announce the next round.

Thanks to everyone for your hard work and creativity in putting these together - this is the kind of thinking and sharing
that makes the Clojurist Together community so awesome!
