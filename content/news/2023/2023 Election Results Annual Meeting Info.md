Greetings Clojurists!

On behalf of the board, I am happy to announce that the board election results are in. With almost 30% of the membership submitting ballots, we have two returning board members - **Daniel Compton** and **Heather Moore-Farley**. Our two new board members are **Felix Barbalet** and **Max Penet**. Congratulations to all - and thanks to everyone who volunteered. The new board positions are for 2-year terms. 

Also a huge thanks to our departing board members **Chris Nuernberger** and **Ikuru Kanuma** for their commitment to Clojurists Together and time spent supporting our developers and their projects.

Please join us at the Annual Members Meeting this week - [10th of  October, 10 a.m. Pacific Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Clojurists+Together+Members+Meeting&iso=20231010T10&p1=224&ah=1). **For an email reminder that includes the Zoom link, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPg4bHzqBlhA0CdMERQPS-X9UXuJWrdeNCBcB1jslumZ3m0A/viewform).**
