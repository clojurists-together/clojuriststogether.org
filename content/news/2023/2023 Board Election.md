Clojurists Together is in the process of [electing new board members](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/2023-board-nominations-and-our-annual-meeting/) as half of our existing board members will be finishing their term.

We received 2 applications from board members who would like to continue to serve and from 5 new candidates. We will be selecting 4 candidates to serve two-year terms. These candidates are all talented Clojurists that we would love (and would be honored) to have on the board.


The board has nominated all 7 candidates for the current board election (in alphabetical order of first names):

* Chip
* Daniel Compton (current Treasurer/Secretary)
* Felix
* Heather Moore-Farley (Current board member)
* Job
* Max
* Vincenzo


### Next Steps

All current Clojurists Together members will be shortly receiving their ballot to vote. If you haven't received a ballot by 3rd October, please contact kdavis@clojuriststogether.org.

Voting will close on 7th October at midnight Pacific Time. The top four candidates, as voted on by members will win. We will announce the winners shortly afterwards and you'll be able to meet them at the Annual members meeting at [10 am Pacific time, October 10, 2023](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Clojurists+Together+Members+Meeting&iso=20231010T10&p1=224&ah=1).
