## Call for Proposals
Clojurists Together is pleased to announce that we are opening our Q3 2023 funding round for Clojure Open Source Projects. 
Applications are open until the 20th of July 2023. [**Apply today!**](https://clojuriststogether.org/open-source/)

We will be awarding a total of $44,000 USD for 8 projects – 4 projects at $2,000 each and 4 projects at $9,000 each. 
The $2k funding tier is for experimental projects or smaller proposals, whereas the $9k tier is for those that are more established. 
Projects generally run 3 months, however, the $9K projects can run between 3 and 12 months as needed. 
We expect projects to start for this round between Sept. 1 and Oct. 1, 2023.

We surveyed our members in late June - to find out what types of initiatives they would like us to focus on for this round of funding. 
Their responses are summarized below. Thanks as always – it is extremely helpful in ensuring that the community is a vital source of input.

If you work on a Clojure open source project, especially one mentioned as a focus area for our members, please consider [applying](https://clojuriststogether.org/open-source/).

### What would you like to be different in the Clojure community in the next 12 months?  
<br>
**Documentation**  
-  about documentation. The documentation is completely unacceptable for the language and for most libraries. It is often poorly written, entirely absent, or lacking examples.
- Much better and slicker documentation and outreach. Documentation that is slick and fun and makes it clear how you enter into using the language and why.
