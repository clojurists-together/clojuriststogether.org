Clojurists Together is in the process of [electing new board members](/news/clojurists-together-board-nominations-and-annual-members-meeting/) as half of our existing board members finish their term.

After accepting applications for nominations, we received 16 applications from candidates. These candidates were all talented Clojurists that we would love to have on the board.

Our bylaws state:

> The Board shall nominate no more than 12 candidates seeking board membership in any given election. In nominating candidates for Director positions and in choosing the number of candidates to nominate overall, the Board shall use reasonable efforts to maintain a Board composition consisting of at least: (1) 25% female Directors, (2) 25% non-Caucasian Directors, and (3) 35% from any category(ies) of persons (e.g., race, gender, ability) commonly considered to have suffered from discrimination at some time and then-currently under-represented in the technology industry, in each case as determined by the Board in its reasonable discretion.

The board has nominated the following 12 candidates for the current board election:

* Alan Thompson
* Ashima Panjwani
* Chris Nuernberger
* Dan Sutton
* Daniel Compton
* Daniel Slutsky
* Erik Assum
* Heather Moore-Farley
* Ikuru Kyogoku

### Next Steps

All current Clojurists Together members will be shortly receiving their ballot to vote. If you haven't received a ballot by Monday, 12th April, please contact hi@clojuriststogether.org.

Voting will close on Monday 19th April, 2021 at midnight Pacific Time. The top four candidates, as voted on by members will win. We will announce the winners shortly afterwards and you'll be able to meet them at the Annual members meeting at [9am Pacific time, April 29th, 2021](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Clojurists+Together+annual+members+meeting&iso=20210429T16&p1=%3A&ah=1).

* Twitter: [@daslu_](https://twitter.com/daslu_)

#### Why they'd like to join

I think CT has an important role in nurturing the Clojure ecosystem.

CT's support has already affected numerous important projects, and in some situations, it can be really transformative. It may allow the extra attention that some projects need for maturing well. For new contributors, it may give the substantial push that is needed for getting involved in the details and becoming comfortable as maintainers.

Clojure has a hopeful prospect of becoming friendlier, well-known, and widely used by broader audiences. A few of us are discussing that continuously at Scicloj and planning some possible paths to get there. It will be difficult but doable, I think. CT's support will surely serve an important role in that, and I want to help in making that happen.

In the last two years, I have been involved in building some parts of the Clojure ecosystem, mainly through community building and library maintenance at Scicloj. I have also worked closely with two developers during their CT projects.

Hopefully, my experience as an organiser -- in open source communities as well as in local grassroots communities throughout the years -- can serve CT well in thinking about projects and the human dynamics around them.

#### Bio

Daniel Slutsky is a mathematician and a programmer. Currently, his main activity is in the organising team of the Scicloj community, which is building some parts of the Clojure ecosystem for data science. He has been one of the main developers of the Clojisr library and Notespace tool and has supported a few community members in becoming active contributors to libraries such as Tablecloth and tech.ml.dataset.

* [slipset.github.io](https://slipset.github.io)

#### Why they'd like to join

I am an active member of the Clojure community, both as a speaker and maintainer of several project, especially through my work with clj-commons. I believe that there is room for other ways than the three months grants of sponsoring important Clojure OSS projects, and would like to work with exploring different options in this area.

### Heather Moore-Farley

* GitHub: [@tophat8855](https://github.com/tophat8855)

#### Why they'd like to join

I’m interested in joining the Clojurists Together Committee because I’ve really benefitted from some of the projects that Clojurists Together has supported in the past and I’d love to have a part in supporting more projects. I’m at a point in my life where I want to contribute more to the community around me and this feels like a good way to do that. I’ve been on non-profit boards before and I know the work of  board meetings and prep and followups isn’t glamorous, but is really important for organizations to feel like they are going somewhere, and for increasing a feeling of community. I think it can be easy to feel like a lone developer working on a project, but knowing groups like CT are supporting projects can alleviate that a bit. And CT can’t support projects without a committee.

#### Bio

Heather is a software engineer, knitter, and bicyclist. She has been coding with Clojure and Clojurescript full-time for 3 years at Mayvenn. In her 6 years of professional software development, she has both benefitted from and contributed to open source projects.

### Ikuru Kyogoku - Parkside

* GitHub: [@iku000888](https://github.com/iku000888)
* Twitter: [@iku000888](https://twitter.com/iku000888)

#### Why they'd like to join

In short, I want the following to happen with Clojurists Together:

- Advance transparency around the project selection process. i.e. public meeting minutes
- Support ambitious long shot projects that are potentially game changing, such as https://twitter.com/cgrand/status/1350063059864346624
- Strengthen support for community initiatives; funding a remote beginner workshop comes to mind, but the point is looking at areas that have not been funded in the past.

I believe I am a good fit because beyond my professional Clojure experience, I can contribute to the diversity of the community by reaching the Clojure community in Japanese.


#### Bio

Ikuru Kyogoku is a U.S. based Software Engineer working at Parkside developing a trading platform on Kafka and Datomic.

Before that he has been a Clojure developer by trade in Japan since 2016 at various places developing webapps (frontend & backend) and a little bit on a react native app(re-natal).

### Kenny Williams - Compute Software

#### Why they'd like to join

As a Clojurists Together Committee member, I hope to represent small companies built on Clojure and its ecosystem. I co-founded Compute Software in 2017, and we rely heavily on open source libraries (e.g., re-frame, shadow-cljs, reitit, & more). I owe much our ability to deliver product quickly to Clojure and the rich ecosystem of open source Clojure(Script) libraries.

#### Bio

* GitHub: [@kiramclean](https://github.com/kiramclean)
* Personal website: [kiramclean.com(https://kiramclean.com)

#### Why they'd like to join

I've been working with Clojure full time for about 2 years now and am pretty keen to stick with it as my primary language. I love the language and the community, and am looking for ways to give back. I think I would be a good fit because I have big hopes and dreams for Clojure. I want to see the language and community thrive and think I could help. Admittedly some of this is selfish because I would really love to be able to keep getting paid to write Clojure forever, but I'm more motivated by the possibility of helping to teach more new Clojure programmers and introduce it to people who might not otherwise consider it. I think I could also offer a useful, maybe different perspective as a young(ish), less experienced Clojurian.

#### Bio

Kira is a software developer from Montreal, Canada, currently working with Swirrl building tools for publishing open data on the web. She's passionate about open data and open standards, and dreams of an internet that mostly works.

#### Why they'd like to join

I've used clojure in a variety of academic and professional settings. I used clojure for a first of its kind scraping and machine learning use-case at Kimono labs (acquired by Palantir). Subsequently, I used Clojure for a variety of state of the art natural language processing and program-synthesis problems at Onai. A couple of these resulted in publications at top computer science venues. I have experience managing clojure codebases, helping teams adopt and successfully deploy clojure in the domains of AI, frontend and other additional use-cases like formal methods, and model checking. Besides engineering work, I have a successful track record of AI research, and formal methods research (organizing workshops at NASA in formal methods and cryptography).

#### Bio

Shriphani Palakodety (Onai) is a software engineer, sculptor and cartographer. His primary research focus is low resource natural language processing, formal methods, and cryptography. He organized the first workshop on formal methods for cryptography at the NASA Formal Methods conference in 2020. His work on low-resource NLP with applications to refugee crises was covered in international press outlets. Shriphani's maps and cartography have been covered in major news outlets in India and his geospatial work and resources are widely used by GIS practitioners. His sculptures have been displayed at galleries in the Bay Area, California and Vancouver, British Columbia.
