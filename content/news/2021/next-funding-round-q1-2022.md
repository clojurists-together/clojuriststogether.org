**Clojurists Together is starting our next funding round for Q1 2022. Applications are open until the 10th of January 2022. [Apply](/open-source/) today!**

Developers can choose between three different funding tiers ($1,000, $2,000, $9,000) and can decide on the length of the funding, from 3 to up to 12 months (for the $9,000 tier). In addition, funding can be delayed by up to two months. The $1k and $2k funding tiers are for experimental projects, whereas the $9k tier for more established projects.

Similar to the [last funding round](q3-2021-funding-announcement), we are planning to fund three developers for each tier, resulting in 9 developers in total and a total funding amount of $36,000.
